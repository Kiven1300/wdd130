        <p>Hi! My name is Kevin Gonzalez Alvarez and I'm from Mexico, Mexico City. I really enjoy spend time with my
            family and friends, exploring new places, and learning new things. Also, I'm student of Software Development
            in BYU IDAHO. I'm looking forward to improving my skills in web development and in the future be part of a
            big tech company.</p>

        <p>Mexico City is a very special place because of its food, people, culture, and the many places you can visit
            and enjoy. The weather is also very pleasant. Many people come to Mexico City just to experience the
            climate. Mexico City is the second city in the world with the most museums, and the best part is that many
            of them are free. For these and many other reasons, Mexico City is a great place to visit on vacation or
            whenever you want.</p>
